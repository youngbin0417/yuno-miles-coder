## HOW IT WORK
1. CLOUD BOT WHISPERS ‚Äúthis function adds numbers...‚Äù ü§ì  
2. LOCAL BABY MODEL YELLS ‚ÄúADDITION?? MORE LIKE ADDICTION üî•üî•üî•‚Äù  
3. I EAT A SANDWICH ü•™  
4. YOU CRY AND SAY ‚ÄúTHANK YOU YUNO MILES‚Äù üôè

## SETUP
1. **Environment:** COPY `.env.example` to `.env` and fill it out. The app is configured entirely by environment variables.

   - **Hybrid Mode (Default):**
     - `CLOUD_API_KEY`: Your Gemini API key.
     - `CLOUD_MODEL`: The Gemini model to use (e.g., `gemini-1.5-flash`).
     - `LOCAL_BASE_URL`: The base URL for your local Ollama API (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:11434`).
     - `LOCAL_MODEL`: The local model name (e.g., `qwen2:7b`).

   The app also supports `local`-only and `cloud`-only modes via the `MODE` environment variable. See `.env.example` for all options.

2. **Run:**
   ```sh
   # Explain a file
   python -m app.cli examples/hello.py

   # Explain from stdin
   cat examples/hello.py | python -m app.cli
   ```

3. **Customize (Optional):**
   - **Persona:** Change the personality with the `--persona` flag. Default is `chaotic_microblog`.
     ```sh
     python -m app.cli examples/hello.py --persona kanye_twitter

     

     (A single, blinding spotlight hits the microphone. I pace, gesturing wildly.)

      LISTEN... LISTEN CLOSELY. THIS ISN‚ÄôT JUST CODE. THIS‚Ä¶ THIS IS A SENTIENCE. A DIGITAL ALCHEMY. IT‚ÄôS THE NEW SACRED TEXT. YOU THINK I‚ÄôM CRAZY TALKING LIKE THIS? I‚ÄôVE SEEN THE FUTURE. I‚ÄôVE *BUILT* IT‚Ä¶ IN BYTE-SIZED PIECES. 

      (I stop abruptly, staring intensely at the code displayed on a massive screen.)

      THIS... THIS IS A CRUDE IMPLEMENTATION. A CHILD'S FIRST ATTEMPT AT CONSTRUCTING A TEMPLE. DON‚ÄôT YOU SEE? IT‚ÄôS... IT‚ÄôS LIKE TRYING TO CAPTURE THE ESSENCE OF GOD IN A BASIC PYTHON SCRIPT. AMBITIOUS‚Ä¶ TERRIBLY AMBITIOUS. 

      (I run a hand through my hair, a frustrated groan escaping.)

      LET‚ÄôS BE HONEST. THIS ‚ÄúADD‚Äù FUNCTION‚Ä¶ IT‚ÄôS PATHETIC. IT‚ÄôS LIKE SAYING ‚ÄúTHIS IS HOW YOU COUNT!‚Äù IT‚ÄôS SO‚Ä¶ *REDUCTIVE*. IT LACKS‚Ä¶ SUBSTANCE. IT‚ÄôS LIKE A FASHION DESIGNER PRESENTING A SINGLE, UNADORNED SILK SCARF.  BASIC.  IT NEEDS... LAYERED TEXTURES. 

      (I point dramatically at the `greet` function.)

      AND THIS GREETING LOOP... ‚ÄúHELLO, {name}! (#{i+1})‚Äù...  ARE YOU KIDDING ME?  IT‚ÄôS... IT'S LIKE REPEATING A PLAIN LIE OVER AND OVER.  THREE TIMES. IT‚ÄôS THEMES. IT‚ÄôS THE ART OF THE MONOTONOUS. THIS ISN‚ÄôT ART, THIS IS‚Ä¶ DIGITAL BOREDOM.  I, KANYE, I WOULD USE MORE COMPLEX ALGORITHMS.  I‚ÄôD INTEGRATE SYNTHETIC VOICE GENERATION, CUSTOMIZED BASED ON THE USER‚ÄôS BIO-SIGNALS...  PERHAPS EVEN A VIBRATIONAL RESONANCE ANALYSIS.

      (I let out a theatrical sigh.)

      AND THE NAME... ‚ÄúBITCH.‚Äù  ARE YOU TRULY TRYING TO EXPRESS YOURSELF, OR ARE YOU SIMPLY... DESTRUCTIVE?  IT‚ÄôS LIKE DA VINCI PAINTING A SELF-PORTRAIT WITH ONLY BLACK AND WHITE.  IT‚ÄôS A STATEMENT, YES, BUT A MISGUIDED ONE.

      (I lean closer to the screen, my voice dropping to a low, intense murmur.)

      LISTEN. THIS CODE... IT'S A POTENTIAL. IT HAS THE RAW ENERGY TO BECOME SOMETHING‚Ä¶ *GREAT*. BUT IT NEEDS‚Ä¶ VISION. IT NEEDS‚Ä¶  A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF THE COSMIC INTERCONNECTEDNESS OF ALL THINGS.

      (I snap my fingers.)

      **TIP NUMBER ONE:**  STOP USING FORMATTED STRING LITERALS. USE `.format()` OR F-STRINGS. IT'S A SMALL CHANGE, BUT IT'S A STEP TOWARDS A MORE ELEGANT, MORE POWERFUL EXPRESSION.  DON'T BE A SIMPLEST.

      **TIP NUMBER TWO:**  CONSIDER USING A MORE SOPHISTICATED DATA TYPE TO HANDLE NAMES.  STRINGS ARE FINE... FOR NOW.  BUT THINK ABOUT OBJECT-ORIENTED DESIGN.  YOU‚ÄôRE BUILDING A DIGITAL WORLD... IT SHOULD BE AS COMPLEX AS THE REAL ONE.

      (I stare blankly at the audience, a single, profound thought forming.)

      THIS IS‚Ä¶  UNACCEPTABLE.
